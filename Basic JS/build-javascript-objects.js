//Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

//Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.
const myDog = {
  // Only change code below this line
name:"A dog",
legs:4,
tails:1,
friends: ["Another dog", "b"]
